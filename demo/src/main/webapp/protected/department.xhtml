  <p>
    This quickstart demonstrates how we can use PicketLink IDM's groups and roles to provide authorization checks within an application.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The identity management configuration is based on PicketLink's JPAIdentityStore, which uses a database to store the application's
    users, groups and roles, and the relationships between them.
  </p>

<h:form id="departmentForm">
    <h:messages globalOnly="true"/>

    <p>
        These departments are available for #{identity.account.name}.
    </p>

    <div class="departmentRow">
        <ui:repeat value="#{authorizationChecker.departments}" var="_department">
            <h:commandLink value="#{_department.name}" action="#{authorizationChecker.assignDepartment(_department.name)}"/>
            <br/>
        </ui:repeat>
    </div>

    <p>
      Each of these departments has different privileges assigned to them.
    </p>

    <ui:fragment rendered="#{authorizationData.department ne null}">
        <div class="departmentRow">
            <h:commandButton value="Join" action="index.xhtml?faces-redirect=true"/>
        </div>
    </ui:fragment>

    <p>
        Current department: #{authorizationData.department ne null ? authorizationData.department.name : 'No department assigned'}.
    </p>

    <p>
        <h:commandButton id="logout" value="Log out" action="#{loginController.logout}"/>
    </p>

</h:form>
